# Dall-E using MERN Stack

Welcome to the DALLE Clone repository! This project is a full-stack implementation of OpenAI's DALL-E, built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The goal of this project is to recreate the functionality of DALL-E, a model that generates images from textual descriptions, providing a seamless user experience from the front end to the back end.

## Features-
* Text-to-Image Generation: Generate images from textual descriptions using a pre-trained DALL-E model.
* User Authentication: Secure user login and registration using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
* Image Gallery: Users can view, save, and share generated images.
* Responsive Design: A user-friendly interface that works across all devices.
* RESTful API: A robust backend API built with Express.js to handle image generation and user management.

## Technologies Used-
* MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user data and generated images.
* Express.js: Backend framework for building the RESTful API.
* React.js: Frontend library for building interactive user interfaces.
* Node.js: JavaScript runtime for the backend server.

## Project Structure-
The project is divided into two main parts:

### Backend:

* Developed using Node.js and Express.js.
* Manages user authentication, interacts with the database, and communicates with the DALL-E model.
* Provides a RESTful API for the frontend to consume.

### Frontend:

* Developed using React.js.
* Provides a responsive and interactive user interface.
* Communicates with the backend API to perform operations like image generation, user authentication, and data retrieval.
